todo:

- virtualising the Timeline and Backlog rows, if load ever needs to get
  faster again. Measured at 4x CPU throttle over 611 entries and 250 backlog
  items (0.136.1): first row ~320-660ms, and of the browser's own time
  RecalcStyle was 136ms and Layout 65ms against **18,388 DOM nodes** —
  ScriptDuration was 24ms, so neither the app's own logic nor compiling its
  690KB of JS is the cost. The load is one ~150ms frame and then smooth; the
  idle trickle behaves.

  The only lever left is building fewer nodes: ~30 per entry is what makes
  style recalc expensive. That means not building rows for sections nowhere
  near the viewport, which the IntersectionObserver already half does — the
  trickle deliberately fills the rest so the document reaches its true height
  and the scrollbar stops moving under you. Virtualising means owning that
  height yourself (estimated row heights, a spacer per unbuilt section), and
  it costs find-in-page over unbuilt rows. Not worth it at this size; the
  numbers above are the baseline to beat if it ever is.

Ideas that turned out not to be worth doing, or not to be possible, live in
DROPPED.md rather than sitting here unread.

Two neighbours: **NOTES.md** carries the reasoning behind what's already
shipped — read it before changing something that looks arbitrary — and
**DROPPED.md** is what was decided against, so the same idea doesn't get
re-litigated every few months.
