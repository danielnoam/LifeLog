todo:

- rework timeline visual
- rework visuals for categories, finance tab, and finance stats — make them all consistent in style
- bulk editing for timeline entries
- bulk editing for finance entries

done:

- remove the journal Categories tab — editing a category now happens via
  the ✎ button on its filter chip (matching Finance); per-category counts
  already live in journal Stats
- version/change history in Settings: keep a small rollback history (not a full audit log) so you can revert to a recent prior state of your data
- add repeating expenses
- centralize import/export in Settings: both the journal data (Timeline/Categories/Backlog) and Finance data should support import/export as CSV and JSON, not just JSON for one and CSV for the other
- tabs menu: group the journal tabs (Timeline, Categories, Stats, Backlog) under a "Journal" header and the finance tabs (Finance, Finance Stats) under a "Finance" header, instead of renaming each individual tab
